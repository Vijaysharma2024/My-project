# My-project
Smart Invigilation is an AI-powered system designed to enhance exam monitoring by automating the invigilation process. This project integrates computer vision, machine learning, and automation to detect malpractice, monitor candidate behavior, and ensure a fair examination environment.
AI-based Candidate Monitoring – Uses facial recognition and behavior analysis to detect suspicious activities.
Real-time Cheating Detection – Identifies unauthorized devices, multiple faces, and unusual movements.
Secure Authentication – Verifies candidate identity before and during the exam.
Automated Alerts – Generates real-time notifications for potential violations.
Post-Exam Analysis – Provides detailed reports and flagged events for review.

Technologies Used:

OpenCV & Deep Learning – For facial and object recognition.
Machine Learning Models – To analyze behavior patterns.
Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch – For backend processing.
Flask/Django – For web-based monitoring dashboards.
Database (MySQL/MongoDB) – To store session logs and reports.
